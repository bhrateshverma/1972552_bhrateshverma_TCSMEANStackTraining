        <p>COVAXINÂ®, India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech is developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV).
            The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility. 
            The vaccine is developed using Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines do not replicate and are therefore unlikely to revert and cause pathological effects. 
            They contain dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system to mount a defensive reaction against an infection.</p>

        Why develop Inactivated Vaccine?
    </div>
    <p class="myanimation">
        Conventionally, inactivated vaccines have been around for decades. Numerous vaccines for diseases such as Seasonal Influenza, Polio, Pertussis, Rabies, 
        and Japanese Encephalitis use the same technology to develop inactivated vaccines with a safe track record of >300 million doses of supplies to date. 
        It is the well-established, and time-tested platform in the world of vaccine technology.
